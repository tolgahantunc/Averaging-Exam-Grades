# Averaging Exam Grades

This program reads three numbers per line from the standard input and up to a maximum of 1000 lines. For each line, it takes the weighted average of these numbers with weights 0.2, 0.4, and 0.4. It prints out the averaged value on a seperate line on the standard output.

For example, for the input below  
45.00 67.00 98.00  
89.00 23.00 89.00

It produces  
75.00  
62.60
